1: You need a web browser. Please install Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) if you don’t already have it. For game development, Chrome offers certain advantages: it has gamepad support, it has great internal developer tools, and it is guaranteed to work with Phaser.

2: You need a server account. For security reasons, your browser can’t load files in the same way it loads websites, so your game has to be ‘served’ to your browser by a server. 

I’ve set up a live webserver that we’ll be doing most of our development on. The address is: http://gcserver.magnet.nyu.edu

You have a personal folder on the server that is private, and a subfolder called ‘public_html’ that is visible to the whole world. You’ll attach your folder to your computer as a network drive, and then you can just write code and save art and music to that drive and it will be available on the server.

Don't change anything in there for now - we’ll go through the setup process in class. But for class you'll need your login details. Here they are:

Username: gordon

Password (randomly generated): riddenhunger

Directory: http://gcserver.magnet.nyu.edu/~gordon

If I got your name wrong, let me know and I can make you a new account with the right name.
